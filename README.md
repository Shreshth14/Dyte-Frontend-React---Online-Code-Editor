# Dyte-Frontend-React---Online-Code-Editor

## Preparing System Requirements
1. Install **_npm_** and **_node.js_** in your system from this link - https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
2. To check whether both are installed correctly, open **Command Prompt** and type:
  - node -v
  - npm -v
3. Install **_VS Code_** from this link - https://code.visualstudio.com/download.
4. Now, we will make our system capable for implementing this project by installing some packages using the following commands in _Terminal_ of VS Code:
  - npx create-react-app my-app
  - cd _location of my-app in our system_
  - npm i codemirror react-codemirror2
  - npm i --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
  - npm i --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
  - npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core

Now we are ready for implementation.

## Steps for implementation
1. Clone this repository in **my-app** and open the files in VS Code.
2. Type **npm start** in the Terminal of VS Code and http://localhost:3000/ opens in web browser with the required implementation.

If this doesn't work, follow these steps:
1. Open each file individually and copy the code.
2. Delete code in my-app for _App.js, Editor.js, index.css,_ and _index.js_.
3. Paste the codes for _App.js, Editor.js, index.css, index.js_ in the same name files in my-app and save.
4. Download the files - _manifest.json, index.html_ and _useLocalStorage.js_ from this repository in my-app.
5. Now, open all the above files in VS Code and open Terminal. Type **npm start**.
